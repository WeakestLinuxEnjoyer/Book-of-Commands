# Book-of-Commands
A collection of commands that I use to solve various problems with their back stories organized by date of creation. This is a journal of my adventure in commandline; inspired by [The Art of Commandline](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) that helped me to love the commandline as a new Linux user. Unlike The Art of Commandline, this is ***NOT*** a guide. I'd be delighted if you find this somehow helpful though.
